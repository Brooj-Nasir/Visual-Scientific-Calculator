# Visual Scientific Calculator Documentation

## Overview

The Visual Scientific Calculator is a comprehensive Windows Forms application in C++ designed to function as both a standard and scientific calculator. This versatile tool allows users to perform a wide range of arithmetic and scientific calculations through an intuitive graphical interface.

## Features

- **Standard Mode**: Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Mode**: Includes advanced functions such as trigonometric calculations, logarithms, exponentiation,Conversions, Powers, Inverses and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use buttons and a clear display for efficient input and result visualization.
- **Menu Navigation**: Switch seamlessly between standard and scientific modes using the menu options.
- **Memory Functions**: Store and recall values to facilitate complex calculations.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the calculator application to open the main interface.
2. **Switch Modes**: Use the menu to switch between Standard and Scientific modes.
3. **Input Numbers and Operations**:
   - Click numeric buttons (`0` through `9`) to enter numbers.
   - Click operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for arithmetic operations.
   - Use scientific functions like `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`,`1\x`,`Octal` ,`Binary`,`Hexa`,`tanh`,`Sqrt`,`Mod`, ` x^2` etc., for advanced calculations.
4. **Calculate Result**: Click the `=` button to compute and display the result.
5. **Clear Input**: Click the `CE` button to clear the current input or the backspace button to delete the last digit.
6. **Additional Features**: Use buttons for memory storage, retrieval, and advanced functions like `Ï€`, `sqrt`, `exp`, etc.

## Code Files

- **[MyForm.h](here)**: Contains the declaration of the `MyForm` class and the design of the calculator interface. This file includes the initialization of components, button definitions, and layout settings for both standard and scientific modes.

- **[MyForm.cpp](here)**: Implements the functionality of the `MyForm` class. This file includes the main entry point for the application and the event handlers for button clicks, enabling the calculator's functionality.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework
- Windows Operating System
- Visual Studio (for development and building the application)
